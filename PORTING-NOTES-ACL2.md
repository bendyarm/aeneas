# ACL2 backend — porting notes (branch `acl2-backend`)

State of this branch: `Config.ml`, `Main.ml`, and `tests/test_runner/Backend.ml`
carry the real `Acl2` additions; `src/extract/ExtractAcl2.ml.draft` encodes the
printer design (not yet compiled — rename to `.ml` when completing it). The
build intentionally does NOT yet compile: adding the `Acl2` constructor makes
every `match … backend () …` non-exhaustive, which is the work list.

## The mechanical procedure

1. `cd src && dune build 2>&1 | head` — the OCaml compiler enumerates every
   non-exhaustive match (≈274 sites at branch time). Work through them
   file by file; each falls into one of these classes:

   | Class | What `Acl2` should do |
   |---|---|
   | Pure string choices (keywords, separators, comment syntax, file ext) | sexp-world answers: `;;` comments, `.lisp` extension, `-` separator, lowercase file names |
   | F*/Coq/HOL4-vs-Lean forks (`backend_choice`) | almost always join the F*/Coq/HOL4 arm |
   | Formatter decisions (boxes, indents, parens) | usually irrelevant for sexp output — pick the simplest arm; real printing lives in `ExtractAcl2` |
   | Backend-specific features (decreases clauses, Lean lakefile, Coq `Arguments`) | no-op for `Acl2` |
   | Semantic decisions (tuple projectors, field-name disambiguation, variant naming) | follow the plan §3.2 contract: conses for tuples, crate-prefixed UPPER-HYPHEN names, always-`:xvar` for FTY |
   | Genuinely unclear | `craise` with a "TODO: ACL2 backend" message — grep-able debt, better than a guess |

2. Complete `ExtractAcl2.ml` (the draft documents each construct's target
   form). The binder plumbing (FVar/BVar, db scopes) should mirror
   `PrintPure.ml`; the sexp layer makes everything else trivial.

3. Wire the seam in `Translate.ml`: when `backend () = Acl2`, route
   declaration groups to `ExtractAcl2` (initially bypassing the
   `ExtractBase` formatter machinery; revisit per maintainer preference —
   upstream question #3 in the tracking-issue draft).

4. Tests: `tests/acl2/` + an allowlist-driven `make test-acl2` /
   `make verify-acl2` (cert.pl), per the plan's Stage 2. `Backend.ml`
   already has the `Acl2` variant, deliberately not in `all`.

## Environment facts (Claude cloud sandbox, for CI-of-the-fork planning)

- ACL2 master builds from source in ~2 min (SBCL); the needed book subset
  certifies in ~39 min at `-j2`; certified tree ≈ 2.0 GB, ≈ 0.6 GB zstd.
- The sandbox cannot build charon (needs `nightly-2026-06-01` + rustc-dev;
  rustup dist server blocked) nor fetch opam packages (opam.ocaml.org
  blocked). GitHub itself and GitHub release assets ARE reachable.
- Consequence: to iterate on this branch inside such a sandbox, ship a
  dev-container rootfs via release assets containing: the opam switch with
  aeneas deps installed (+ dune), charon built at `charon-pin` (binary +
  charon-ml built in the switch), the pinned Rust nightly toolchain, and
  ACL2 + the certified book subset. Then the edit→`dune build`→extract→
  `cert.pl` loop runs entirely offline.

## Known workaround: unrolling loops that call heavy functions

ACL2's admission of a *recursive* (fuel) loop function whose body reaches a large
callee expands that callee during admission and can blow up super-linearly. The
extracted AES-128 key schedule first exhibited this: the `rcon` loop calls
`key_round` → `sub_bytes` (the 113-gate S-box), and the loop book took >9 minutes
to certify (and did not finish). The same shape appears for any loop that calls a
heavy function.

Two fixes, both verified:

1. **Unrolling (used in the vendored AES).** A loop with a statically-known trip
   count is written straight-line, so its extraction is non-recursive and admits
   in seconds (the encrypt/decrypt rounds and the key-schedule `rcon` loop). The
   round body stays a single shared function (`key_round`, `sub_bytes`, …), so
   there is no duplicated logic — only repeated one-line calls. Faithful only
   because the counts are static (AES-128); NOT a general solution.

2. **Principled fix (TODO in ExtractAcl2).** Emit `(in-theory (disable <callee>))`
   for heavy callees before the loop functions that call them (and, for
   backward-compatible downstream proofs, re-`enable` at end of book). Confirmed
   locally: disabling `key_round` before the `rcon` loop makes the *recursive*
   version admit in ~6s. This keeps genuine (non-static-count) loops as loops.
   Disabling a `:definition` rune does not disable its `:executable-counterpart`,
   so execution-based known-answer tests still run.

## Resolved: the `fail` runtime macro used to collide with centaur/gl

The Phase-2 bijection proof (`tests/acl2/aes_fixslice_bijection.lisp`) bit-blasts
the extracted `bitslice`/`inv_bitslice` with **centaur/gl**, so a single ACL2
world must hold both the extracted code and GL. It cannot: `rust-primitives`
defines `fail` as a *macro* (a one-line alias, `(defmacro fail (e) `(result-fail
,e))`), while centaur/gl transitively defines a *function* named `fail`
(`misc/hons-help`). ACL2 forbids a macro and a function to share a name in one
world, so `(include-book "centaur/gl/gl")` after the extracted book aborts with
"The name FAIL is in use as a macro." (`ok`, `array-index`, `u32p`, … do NOT
collide — `fail` is the only one.)

RESOLVED (principled fix landed): the printer now emits `result-fail`
directly (two sites in `ExtractAcl2.ml`), the runtime uses `result-fail`
throughout and no longer defines a `fail` macro, and the one handwritten
use (`proofs.lisp`) was updated. Every extracted book is GL-ready as
generated; the `gl-variants` Makefile rule and the two `-gl` variant
files are gone, and `aes_fixslice_bijection` includes the generated book
directly. (`ok` remains a macro — it collides with nothing.) The interim
`sed`-variant approach is preserved in the git history should another
name collision ever appear.

## AES fixslice vendoring: provenance, mechanical audit, de-vendoring roadmap

**Provenance.** `tests/src/aes_fixslice_encrypt.rs` was written BY HAND (no tool
generated it) as an adaptation of RustCrypto `aes` v0.9.1
`src/soft/fixslice32.rs` (repo `RustCrypto/block-ciphers`, tag `aes-v0.9.1`,
commit `507938c`), created in commit `c3555dd1` so the module would go through
today's Charon -> Aeneas -> ACL2 pipeline. The pristine upstream file is checked
in at `tests/src/reference/fixslice32-aes-v0.9.1.rs` (MIT/Apache-2.0) so the
adaptation is diffable forever. The theorems are about the ADAPTED copy; they
transfer to shipped RustCrypto exactly modulo the deltas below.

**Mechanical audit** (function-by-function, whitespace/comment-insensitive;
script-verified against the reference copy):

| Delta class | Functions | Nature |
|---|---|---|
| Byte-identical | `ror`, `ror_distance`, `rotate_rows_*`, `rotate_rows_and_columns_*`, `delta_swap_1/2` (10 fns), and the whole `define_mix_columns!` macro | none |
| ~~Signature-only~~ RESOLVED (pass 7): `sub_bytes`/`sub_bytes_nots`/`inv_sub_bytes`, `shift_rows_*`/`inv_shift_rows_*`, `add_round_constant_bit`, `xor_columns` all take upstream's `&mut [u32]` slices (asserts restored where upstream has them; `mix_columns_*` keep upstream's own `&mut State`) | -- | none |
| ~~`iter_mut`/`zip` -> indexed `for`~~ RESOLVED (pass 10, roadmap #8): `shift_rows_1/2/3` and `add_round_key` bodies are VERBATIM upstream `iter_mut()`/`.zip()` loops; the crate extracts through charon's mono carve-out pipeline (see the Makefile recipe) with the printer's first-order iterator models | -- | none |
| ~~LE byte plumbing~~ RESOLVED (pass 8): `bitslice`/`inv_bitslice` bodies are VERBATIM upstream (`from_le_bytes`/`try_into`, `to_le_bytes`/`copy_from_slice`, out-param `bitslice` with all three asserts); `ld_le` deleted; `BatchBlocks`/`State::default()` -> array literals remain the documented de-sugar | -- | none |
| ~~Subslice borrows -> `(array, offset)` + `read8`/`write8`/`*_at` wrappers~~ RESOLVED (pass 9): `aes128_key_schedule` is verbatim upstream (`&mut rkeys[..8]`/`[off..off+8]` subslice borrows, `(8..72).step_by(32)` fold, `for i in 1..11` NOTs loop); the read8/write8/sub_bytes_at/sub_bytes_nots_at/add_rc_bit_at/inv_shift_rows_*_at/bitslice_into/add_rcon/key_round wrapper layer is DELETED | -- | none |
| ~~Loop unrolls~~ FULLY RESTORED (passes 3 + 11): the encrypt round loop (pass 3) AND the decrypt round loop (pass 11, descending rk_off) are verbatim upstream bare `loop { ... break }` text, extracted as recursive loop functions; key-schedule rcon loop re-rolled earlier | -- | none |
| ~~`memshift32` forward-loop delta~~ FULLY RESOLVED (passes 1 + 7): body verbatim upstream (`.rev()` + both `debug_assert`s, extracting as `massert`s) AND the upstream `&mut [u32]` signature | `memshift32` | none |
| Dropped | `aes192_*`/`aes256_*`, cipher-crate API, `cfg(aes_backend_soft = "compact")` branches (non-compact path vendored) | scope reduction |

**De-vendoring roadmap** — what the toolchain needs so each delta can be
deleted and the audited subject moves toward verbatim upstream:

1. FREE / already zero: macros (rustc expands pre-MIR); `cfg` selection
   (rustc resolves); those deltas need no toolchain work.
2. DONE -- `debug_assert!`: the charon preset KEEPS them (they extract as
   `(massert ...)` ok-binders).  All 11 restorable asserts are restored
   verbatim: memshift32's two (pass 1) plus the nine length asserts on
   sub_bytes / sub_bytes_nots / inv_sub_bytes / shift_rows_1/2/3 /
   bitslice (input0, input1) / inv_bitslice (pass 2).  Proof impact was one
   lemma pair: sub_bytes_nots's :ok/len characterization needed only
   len >= 7 (it touches indices 0,1,5,6) but upstream's assert demands
   len == 8 exactly -- the hypothesis tightened to match, and every call
   site already reads exact-length windows.  The remaining two arrived with
   the signature reversion passes: add_round_key's `rkey.len()` (pass 7,
   with the (state, rkey: &[u32]) signature) and bitslice's `output.len()`
   (pass 8, with the out-param signature) -- ALL THIRTEEN upstream asserts
   are now present verbatim.
3. DONE for everything vendored -- loop re-rolls: key schedule (rcon + fold
   loops) and now the ENCRYPT ROUND LOOP.  The upstream shape is a bare
   `loop` over a mutated `rk_off` counter with the break in the MIDDLE of
   the body (after the mc1 quarter); it extracts as a recursive loop
   function threading (state, rk_off) with the break as an early (ok state)
   return -- no iterator machinery at all.  Proof architecture: enc-collapse
   keeps its statement; a new enc-loop-collapse proves the loop at fuel 100
   equals the nine middle rounds by THREE explicit expansions (fuel 100 at
   rk_off 8, 99 at 40, 98 at 72), with add_round_key fuel-canonicalized by
   a generic-fuel ark-form-n (the loop calls it at decremented fuels).
   Everything downstream of enc-collapse's equation is untouched.
   Regression crate `tests/src/loop_break.rs` (+ known-answer proofs book)
   pins the loop{...break} extraction shape and the expand-collapse proof
   pattern.  The decrypt round loop is not a delta today (decrypt is not
   yet vendored); it re-rolls the same way when the decrypt side lands.
4. DONE, both halves -- `Rev<Range<usize>>` support AND the `memshift32`
   source reversion that it unblocks:
   * Backend: `Iterator::rev` and `Rev::next` have real bodies when charon
     builds against a Miri-provisioned sysroot and translate as-is; WITHOUT
     that sysroot they arrive opaque, so the backend now carries fallback
     syntheses for all four leaves: `rev` and the blanket
     `IntoIterator for Rev<_>` as identity (newtype-erased: a Rev value IS
     its inner range), `Rev::next` and `Range::next_back` as the reverse
     advance.  `core::slice::len` (reached by the restored bounds assert)
     maps to `vec-len`.  Emission is now two-pass (all type groups before
     all fun/global groups): a synthesized `Rev::next` body reads the Range
     defprod's fields, a dependency charon's declaration order cannot know.
   * Source: `memshift32` reverted to VERBATIM upstream body -- `.rev()`
     loop plus both `debug_assert`s, which extract as `massert`s.  Proof
     rework (the write order flips to descending): keychain gains a
     descending spec `ms-spec-d` + step lemmas driven by `rvnext-on-range`,
     bridged to the unchanged ascending interface RHS by `ms-spec-d-is-ms-spec`
     (equal-by-nths over the disjoint windows); the interface lemma
     `memshift32-is-msspec` keeps its RHS and gains upstream's own
     `(rem src 8) = 0` hypothesis, which `rem-8i` discharges at every
     (8-aligned) schedule call site; the length-only `-len` family and the
     fuel-canon/loop-collapse lemmas in keydecomp/keyasm additionally
     thread `true-listp` (the descending<->ascending bridge needs it).
   Regression crate `tests/src/rev_range.rs` (+ known-answer proofs book)
   covers both iterator directions, including the exact upstream
   memshift32 shape, and certifies from the fallback syntheses alone.
5. DONE -- truncating casts: every cast primitive (the def-rust-int-type
   macro family plus the hand-written u32/i32) now models Rust `as` exactly:
   total two's-complement truncation into the target range, never failing.
   New -RK (always :ok), -RANGE (result is in range) and the existing -OK
   (in-range identity) rules form the reasoning interface; the definitions
   are DISABLED by default (a total definition otherwise opens on symbolic
   arguments and spills mod/ifix arithmetic into every goal -- ground calls
   still compute via the executable counterparts).  inv_bitslice's masked
   casts `((w>>k) & 0xff) as u8` are reverted to upstream's bare
   `(w>>k) as u8`.  Known-answer asserts in rust-primitives pin the wrap
   behavior (300 as u8 = 44, 255 as i8 = -1, -1 as u32 = 2^32-1, ...).
6. DONE -- LE byte plumbing:
   runtime prims u32-from-le-bytes / u32-to-le-bytes (total, non-monadic:
   Aeneas types them pure) and slice-copy-from-slice (fails unless lengths
   agree); printer syntheses for slice.try_into() into a fixed byte array
   (constructing core's own monomorphic Result tagsum; the length is read
   off the Ok payload's array type) and Result::unwrap on it.  Validated by
   tests/src/lebytes_probe.rs + known-answer proofs incl. an LE round-trip
   theorem.  The nested write shape upstream's inv_bitslice uses --
   `output[k][o..o+4].copy_from_slice(...)`, a single-element mutable
   index wrapping a range borrow -- is also supported (CloElemBack:
   forward array-index, backward update-nth) and probe-validated
   (st2-known-answer).  The bitslice/inv_bitslice bodies are now VERBATIM
   upstream: out-param bitslice with all THREE debug_asserts (output.len()
   was the last signature-blocked assert -- all 13 upstream asserts are now
   present), from_le_bytes over try_into'd subslice reads, and
   to_le_bytes/copy_from_slice writes through the nested
   output[k][o..o+4] borrows; ld_le is DELETED.  The ~300 proof-side
   bitslice references thread the out-parameter (a (list 0 ... 0) initial
   array, fully overwritten).  GL note: the LE prims are defined via
   logior/ash/logand, NOT +/*/mod -- identical on byte inputs, but adders
   with carries blow the BDD node count (the 48-variable
   add-round-key-through-packing crux went from OOM-at-7GB to 8 seconds on
   this change alone); the explicit inv-bitslice :ok/len lemmas keep the
   window prims at their nth/len interface instead of opening take/append.
7. DONE, both sides -- subslice borrows: Aeneas
   splits `&mut a[lo..hi]` into a forward read returning a (subslice,
   backward-closure) pair, bound via an intermediate pair variable and a
   tuple-destructuring let.  The printer now: synthesizes every shared
   monomorphized `Index<RangeX<usize>>::index` to a first-order defun over
   the new vec-index-range prim (RangeTo/RangeFrom default the missing
   bound to 0 / (len a)); intercepts the mutable pair-lets, prints the
   forward read, and delegates the backward closure to data -- applying it
   prints the total vec-update-range splice (an escaping closure variable
   yields an unbound-variable certification failure, never a silent
   mistranslation).  &mut array-to-slice coercions are the identity with an
   identity backward.  vec-index-range/vec-update-range come with the
   window nth/len/true-listp interface rules.  Validated by
   tests/src/subslice_probe.rs + known-answer AND symbolic proofs.
   ENCRYPT SIDE DONE: every op now has upstream's slice signature
   (sub_bytes/sub_bytes_nots/inv_sub_bytes, shift_rows_*/inv_shift_rows_*,
   add_round_constant_bit, xor_columns, memshift32 -- closing memshift32's
   LAST delta); add_round_key has upstream's (state, rkey: &[u32])
   signature WITH its restored rkey.len() debug_assert, and the
   encrypt/decrypt call sites pass upstream's own &rkeys[..8] /
   &rkeys[rk_off..(rk_off + 8)] / &rkeys[80..] subslices.  Proof
   architecture: enc-chain and everything downstream (ladder, rounds,
   final) are UNTOUCHED -- six window lemmas rewrite each synthesized
   Index<RangeX> read composed with add_round_key straight to the old
   (arkw-spec 0 8 s rk off) form via take8-nthcdr-is-rd8 and an
   arkw-spec window-shift.  SCHEDULE SIDE DONE (pass 9), closing the class:
   * StepBy<Range<usize>> synthesis: StepBy is opaque in the LLBC, so the
     printer emits its own defprod {iter, step, first-take} and synthesizes
     the trio by name -- step_by(step) fails on step == 0 and stores
     step - 1 with first_take = t (upstream's own representation);
     into_iter is the identity; next specializes Iterator::nth to Range
     (first take yields start; afterwards jump to start + (step-1), i.e.
     advance to start + step of the previous yield; park at (end, end)
     when past the end).  Pinned by tests/src/subslice_probe.rs's
     stepby_sum probe (known-answer proof).
   * aes128_key_schedule is verbatim upstream: bitslice into
     &mut rkeys[..8], the rcon loop through &mut rkeys[off..off+8]
     subslices, the (8..72).step_by(32) inv_shift_rows fold, the trailing
     window at [72..80], and the 1..11 NOTs loop; the whole wrapper layer
     (read8/write8/*_at/bitslice_into/add_rcon/key_round) is deleted.
   * Phase-4 proof restack (the schedule now extracts as one inline
     rcon-loop body instead of a key_round function): keyround proves ONE
     LOOP-STEP EQUATION sched-loop0-step -- an iteration of the extracted
     loop0 at index c equals the pure window model kround(rkeys,off,c)
     (the old key-round-unfold's xc/w8/ms-spec tower) -- under LENGTH-ONLY
     hypotheses, so keyasm's loop collapse needs no invariant and no fuel
     canonicalization at all; kround's readers (window/len/frame-below/
     true-listp) replace the key_round interface with strictly weaker
     hypotheses (no wstate, no alignment).  keystep's step-star GL cruxes
     are stated directly over the pure krw8, so keycore's per-round GL
     cruxes over the deleted wrapper went away entirely.  The seed is the
     vec-update-range window form (defund seed).  keyasm collapses the
     three loops -- rcon by induction over sched-loop0-step, the step_by
     fold by explicit three-step expansion through the synthesized StepBy
     next (yields 8, 40, then None), the NOTs loop by the lockstep
     off = 8i induction -- into the same ks-decomp shape, and keyread/
     keymain/windows/ladder are unchanged modulo (seed key).  Two
     rule-shape lessons are recorded in the books: window arithmetic in
     left-hand sides must be a free variable pinned by an
     (equal hi (+ off 8)) hypothesis (embedded (+ off 8) patterns match
     neither ACL2's constant-first sum normal form nor evaluated
     literals), and alignment hypotheses must be stated in MOD form
     (arithmetic-5 normalizes goal-side rem to mod, and backchain relief
     does not cross that normalization).
8. MACHINERY LANDED, probe certified (was "largest unknown") --
   `iter_mut()`/`.zip()` over slices, the last structural de-sugar class
   (shift_rows_*'s per-word loop and add_round_key's iter_mut().zip()).
   Probe: tests/src/itermut_probe.rs (p1 iter / p2 iter_mut / p3 zip /
   p4 verbatim add_round_key / known-answer driver); its extraction and
   proofs are IN the certified suite (itermut_probe{,-proofs}.lisp:
   driver = (ok 44), plus elementwise symbolic theorems with free
   elements -- any slot transposition or off-by-one in the write-back
   model would be unprovable).  How it works:
   * Original finding (still the map): Aeneas CORE supports slice
     iterators on the POLYMORPHIC path; plain --monomorphize bakes
     region-erased borrow-carrying decls that decl-level region analysis
     rejects.  Nested-borrow research was never the blocker.
   * charon fork, mono carve-out (bendyarm/charon 5695c917 + d49928a2):
     under --monomorphize --monomorphize-mut=except-types (plus
     --remove-adt-clauses --lift-associated-types='*'), instantiations
     whose baking would erase unrecoverable regions stay polymorphic --
     types with lifetime args / mut-infected args / region-mentioning
     args; fns with mut-ref signatures under lifetime args; trait
     decls/impls in lockstep so dictionary witnesses stay coherent.
     Inert without --monomorphize-mut (AES extraction byte-identical).
   * aeneas InterpPaths fix (71afbe52): the place write-back check
     compared an erased against an un-erased type.
   * ACL2 printer (this commit): the opaque iterators become first-order
     models -- Iter/IterMut {lst, pos} defprods, Zip {a, b} -- with
     synthesized ctors/next (next yields (opt . iter') and advances);
     iter_mut/zip calls are intercepted at their (forward, backward)
     pair-lets (backward -> closure kinds extracting ->lst / ->a); the
     next triple's next_back becomes CloNextBack (None-application =
     identity; Some only inside wrap lambdas); and the loop's
     arrow-typed back formal is DEFUNCTIONALIZED to a list of pending
     write values: identity closure literal ~> nil, wrap lambda ~>
     (cons v back), applied by emitted -apply-back/-wb-some companions
     on the decrement model (after k nexts pos = k; applying pending
     writes latest-first lands each in the slot its next read; the
     backward pair-extraction then reads the final list out).
     Defunctionalization fires ONLY at loop-call sites; lambdas anywhere
     else keep the loud v0 skip (and a failed shape-probe restores the
     gensym counter, keeping skipped-decl output byte-identical).
   * AES flip DONE (pass 10): shift_rows_1/2/3 and add_round_key are
     verbatim upstream text (byte-compared against the pristine
     reference) and the AES crate extracts through the carved pipeline.
     Proof restack was three books, all exported statements unchanged:
     keydecomp's per-loop base/step/inductions became direct
     wrapper-level unrolls (the (:free ...) :expand hint re-fires at
     each exposed fuel; next reads the ORIGINAL list, writes pending);
     keyasm's two-fuel inductions became double unrolls (both fuel
     spines meet syntactically, (< 8 (nfix n)) deciding the symbolic
     side's zp tests); cipher's ark-loop0 lemmas became a direct
     ark-form-n unroll meeting arkw-spec under the std/lists
     update-nth commuting rules.  The GL books (addroundkey,
     shiftrows, keyschedule, keyfold) recertify UNCHANGED -- GL
     symbolically executes the new machinery.  Extraction wart, known
     and cosmetic: under the carved flags the try_into decl's mangled
     name embeds a hax name-resolution artifact
     ("...tryinto-u8-4usize-type-error-can-t-compute-self-type0-...");
     self-consistent, referenced by no handwritten book, candidate
     charon-side fix.  The panic-path Option instance also arrives
     generic (core-option-option) instead of monomorphized; it is
     referenced by nothing.
9. Whole-crate extraction (cipher traits, generic-array, batch API, AES-192/256):
   long-term; today's audited claim is module-level (the fixslice32 math).

Worked so far: the key-schedule rcon loop was restored to a `for` loop and the
recursive extraction admits fast and re-certifies the whole chain including the
FIPS-197 executable checks — evidence that the "unrollings are required" caveat
was about a pipeline limitation that no longer exists for factored loop bodies.

## Resolved: extraction naming collision on mixed Range instantiations

Instantiating BOTH `Range<usize>` and `Range<i32>` in one crate (an
unannotated `for _i in 1..11` defaults to i32 when nothing constrains the
type) used to make extraction exit nonzero with "The chosen name is already
in the names set: core_ops_range_Range_t".

Root cause, found by reproduction (`tests/src/range_both.rs`): the failure
was in ExtractBase's name REGISTRATION, which Translate.ml runs for every
backend before routing to the printer.  Those names are computed through
charon-ml's pattern machinery, whose `path_elem_with_generic_args_to_pattern`
deliberately drops `PeInstantiated` elements ("patterns match the logical
structure, not the instantiation") -- correct for name MATCHING, wrong when
the same path is reused to generate extraction names for monomorphized
instances.  The ACL2 printer was never affected: it builds its own name maps
from the pretty-printed item name (which keeps `::<usize>`), and the emitted
book was already complete and correct -- only the vestigial registration
errored and failed the run.

Fork fix (landed): Translate.ml skips all five `*_register_names` folds when
the backend is Acl2; the printer's own maps are the single source of truth.
All golden books regenerate byte-identically; `range_both.rs` (+ its
known-answer proofs book) is a permanent regression test.  The `usize` loop
annotations in the vendored AES source are no longer load-bearing.
